Version Release History
=======================

Version 1.1.2 - May 23, 2011
   * Added --just-align and --resume-align options.  --just-align
     causes Crossbow to put the results of the Alignment phase in the
     --output directory and quit after the alignment phase.  You can
     later "resume" Crossbow by specifying this directory as the
     --input directory and specifying the --resume-align option.
   * Fixed issue with .sra input whereby status output from fastq-dump
     would be interpreted as a read.
   * Other minor bugfixes.

Version 1.1.1 - February 7, 2011
   * Added support for the .sra file format, used by the Sequence Read
     Archive.  These files can now be specified in the manifest.
     Crossbow uses the fastq-convert tool from the SRA Toolkit to
     convert .sra files to .fastq files in the preprocess stage.
   * The examples that included defunct SRA FASTQ files were updated to
     point to new .sra files instead.

Version 1.1.0 - October 11, 2010
   * Added --discard-ref-bin and --discard-all options, which can be
     helpful to reduce Crossbow running time when a run's chief purpose
     is to test whether it runs all the way through.
   * Fixed a bug in soapsnp that caused a segmentation fault in the
     last partition of a chromosome when chromosome length is a
     multiple of 64.
   * Revamped the reference jar scripts (in $CROSSBOW_HOME/reftools).
     The new scripts use Ensembl rather than UCSC & dbSNP.  The old
     scripts (db2ssnp* and *_jar) are still there, but are likely to be
     deprecated soon.
   * Fixed a few bugs in the hg19_jar and db2ssnp_hg19 scripts.
   * Removed the hg18_jar script, which was broken by a reorganization
     of the dbSNP site.
   * Uses Bowtie 0.12.7 instead of 0.12.5.
   * Switched Mouse17 example's manifest files back to use .gz
     extension instead of .bz2.

Version 1.0.9 - September 13, 2010
   * Fixed example manifests that point to Short Read Archive files to
     use .bz2 instead of .gz extensions.

Version 1.0.8 - September 4, 2010
   * Set the memory cap on the sort task to be inversely proportional
     to --cpus, to avoid memory footprint blowup on computers with more
     processors.
   * Fixed a final issue that affected how Crossbow handles quality
     value conversion.
   * Fixed issue whereby bzip2'ed data would be handled incorrectly by
     the preprocessor.
   * Fixed counter in Preprocess step that would erroneously refer to
     unpaired reads as paired.  Also "Read data fetched to EC2" has
     been changed to "Read data fetched".
   * In EMR mode, updated where user credentials are found; Amazon
     changed their path sometime around 8/30/2010.
   * In EMR mode, updated the manner in which the bootstrap action is
     specified; the old way was disabled by Amazon sometime around
     8/30/2010.
   * Fixed issue whereby ReduceWrap.pl would crash in cases with a
     large number of bins (>10 million) .
   * NOTE: The Short Read Archive (SRA) seems to be in the midst of a
     reorganization that includes files that were previously gzipped
     being replaced with versions zipped with bzip2.  The files will
     sometimes disappear for a while.  If you are having problems with
     an example where input reads come from the SRA, try renaming files
     in the manifest file as appropriate.  If that doesn't work, please
     contact us.

Version 1.0.7 - August 27, 2010
   * Fixed issue whereby the order of the arguments to bowtie would
     result in a crash when POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.
   * Fixed --keep-all option, which was causing a crash.
   * Fixed a lingering quality bug whereby qualities were converted
     immediately to phred33 but phred64 or solexa64 flags would be
     spuriously passed to Bowtie.

Version 1.0.6 - August 26, 2010
   * Single-computer mode now copies the output that it writes to the
     console to a file 'cb.local.(pid).out'.  Please include the
     contents of this file when reporting issues.
   * Sorting in single-computer mode is now more portable; switched
     from command-line sort to pure-Perl File::Sort.
   * Fixed bug whereby the quality setting would be propagated to
     Bowtie but not to SOAPsnp, causing SOAPsnp to operate with
     incorrect (over-optimistic) quality values when Phred+64 or
     Solexa+64 modes were used.
   * More helpful output from MapWrap.pl and ReduceWrap.pl to make it
     easier to debug issues in single-computer-mode runs.
   * Fixed issue where web form would incorrectly convert + signs in
     AWS secret key to spaces, causing some good credentials to fail
     verification.
   * Fixed issue in preprocessor that mishandles copies when user's AWS
     secret key contains slash characters.

Version 1.0.5 - August 15, 2010
   * Fixed issue that prevented CROSSBOW_EMR_HOME environment variable
     from working.
   * Fixed issue whereby Align.pl script fails to report a count for
     the number of reads with alignments sampled due to Bowtie's -M
     option.
   * Fixed issue whereby scripts in the $CROSSBOW_HOME/reftools
     directory had `#!/bin/sh` headers but were actually bash scripts.
   * Fixed issue that made it difficult to specify a space-separated
     list of arguments to the --bowtie-args and other --*-args
     parameters.
   * Fixed issue whereby most documentation referred to arguments with
     a single-dash prefix, whereas users with the POSIXLY_CORRECT
     environment variable set must use a double-dash prefix.
     Documentation and code have been updated to always use double-dash
     prefixes.

Major revision: Version 1.0.4 - July 21, 2010
   * Crossbow has been largely rewritten as an Amazon Elastic MapReduce
     (EMR) application, as opposed to an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
     application.  EMR runs on top of EC2 and is a more appropriate way
     to run Crossbow for several reasons, including:
     + The AWS Console's Elastic MapReduce tab, together with EMR's
       Debug Job Flow feature, provide a much friendlier interface for
       monitoring and manipulating jobs.
     + The elaborate scripts for automating cluster setup, teardown,
       proxy connection, etc., are all gone.  They are either
       irrelevant now, or else are handled automatically by EMR.
   * A web-based GUI for composing and submitting EMR jobs has been
     added.  Most helpfully, the web GUI has features for
     sanity-checking inputs; e.g. whether the user's credentials as
     entered are valid, whether the input URL exists, etc.
   * Crossbow is now fully "tri-mode", with separate cloud, Hadoop, and
     single-computer operating modes.  All three modes share a great
     deal of common infrastructure, making all three modes easier to
     maintain going forward.
     + Crossbow's Hadoop mode is now much improved, having an interface
       very similar to cloud and single-computer modes.
     + A new single-computer operating mode has been added that (a)
       uses many processors/cores to shorten computation time, and (b)
       does not require the user to have a cloud account or a Hadoop
       installation.  It also doesn't require Java; just appropriate
       versions of Bowtie, SOAPsnp (some of which are included), Perl,
       and other tools.  Its interface is very similar to cloud and
       Hadoop modes.
   * The manual is entirely rewritten.  It now contains information
     about running in all three modes (cloud, Hadoop, single-computer),
     and gives multiple examples for how to run in each mode.
   * Fixed a bug whereby allele frequency columns in the provided
     reference jars had T and G columns switched.
   * SOAPsnp reduce step now outputs more counter and status
     information.
   * SOAPsnp reduce step outputs an additional column per SNP
     indicating paired-end coverage.
   * Compatible with Bowtie versions 0.12.0 and above.  Bowtie 0.12.5
     now included.
   * Many other new options and features.  See manual.

Version 0.1.3 - October 21, 2009
   * cb-local now gives the user clear feedback when worker nodes fail
     to confirm the MD5 signature of the reference jar.  If this
     failure occurs several times per node across all nodes, the
     supplied MD5 is probably incorrect.
   * An extra Reduce step was added to the end of the Crossbow job to
     bin and sort SNPs before downloaded to the user's computer.  This
     step also renames output files by chromosome and deletes empty
     output files.
   * Added another example that uses recently-published mouse
     chromosome 17 data (sequenced by Sudbery et al).  The TUTORIAL
     file now points to this new example.
   * More and clearer messages in the output from cb-local.

Version 0.1.2 - October 12, 2009
   * Many fixes for the scripts that automate the reference-jar
     building process.
   * Added two utility scripts, dist_mfa and sanity_check, to the
     reftools subdirectory.  See their documentation for details.
   * Added scripts for building a reference jar for C. elegans using
     UCSC's ce6 (WormBase's WS190) assembly and information from dbSNP.
     This small genome is used in the new TUTORIAL.
   * New TUTORIAL steps the user through preprocessing reads from the
     NCBI Short Read Archive, creating a reference .jar from a UCSC
     assembly (ce6 in this case) and a set of SNP descriptions from
     dbSNP, then running Crossbow and examining the resulting SNPs.
   * Extended the preprocess-and-copy infrastructure to allow output
     from a single input file to be split over many output files.  This
     is critical for achieving good load balance across a breadth of
     datasets.

Version 0.1.1 - October 9, 2009
   * Added scripts that automate the reference-jar building process for
     UCSC genomes hg18 and mm9.  These scripts can be adapted to other
     species.  See the new "Using Automatic Scripts" subsection of the
     "Building a Reference Jar" section of the MANUAL for details.
   * License agreement files are now organized better.  All licenses
     applying to all software included in Crossbow are in "LICENSE*"
     files in the Crossbow root directory.
   * Minor updates to MANUAL

Version 0.1.0 - October 3, 2009
   * First stable release of Crossbow.
